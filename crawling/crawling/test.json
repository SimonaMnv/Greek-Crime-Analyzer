And whether you take the chance of entertaining or cancel this year\u2019s events, the 2020 holiday season can bring more anxiety than joy -- anxiety that can boost your blood sugars.\nHow to cope? You may be able to avoid stress-driven blood sugar spikes by building happiness into your daily routine. A few suggestions:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},
{"headline": "Lockdown Eating Has Thrown Off My Blood Sugars", "body": "If you\u2019ve found yourself noshing more and exercising less while sheltering in place, you aren\u2019t alone.\nSocial media is packed with recipes for decadent desserts, magnificent casseroles and fail-safe sourdough recipes. Newspaper articles proclaim that people are cooking like never before.\nBut while it\u2019s understandable that letting go of your diet may help you navigate these uncertain times, adding extra pounds during a period of high anxiety is precisely what people with type 2 diabetes don\u2019t need.\u00a0\nWeight gain, after all, can lead to high or fluctuating blood sugars, which in turn can promote serious complications from the disease. As can stress.\nIt isn\u2019t fair. But neither is type 2.\nNone of this is theoretical. Over the past month, I\u2019ve added four stubborn pounds. And though I\u2019ve kept up with my weight lifting and stationary biking, for the first time in years my sugars have been unpredictable \u2013 rising as high as a fasting 180 and as low as 55 mid-day.\nI\u2019d like to say that this is a mystery. But I know better. On infrequent trips to the supermarket, I\u2019ve reached for items that might provide some needed variety \u2013 peanuts, trail mix, yogurt bars. All of which sound healthy, but, eaten in quantity, are anything but.\nPlus, with a full refrigerator, stocked pantry, and lots of extra time to spare, I\u2019ve been keeping my husband happy in this wildly uncertain time with comfort food: thick bean chilis and peanut butter cookies, rice based fish stews, and beef cooked with wine. While I\u2019ve continued life as a pescatarian, I\u2019ve been guilty of an extra bite here and a nibble there, and sometimes \u2013 especially if I\u2019ve been watching the news \u2013 even a few bites more. \u00a0\nThe problem is simple: while eating soothes my rattled nerves, the scale and my blood sugar monitor continue to keep score.\nI\u2019m not alone. A close friend\u00a0with type 2 diabetes has\u00a0also experienced unusual highs and lows. At home from her\u00a0office job without her\u00a0usual structured day, she\u00a0finds herself\u00a0dipping into corn chips and jellybeans, two previously forbidden foods.\n\u201cWhen this is over, I\u2019ll worry about my diabetes,\u201d she\u00a0says.\nI listen to her seductive words. And I get it \u2013 stuck in the house during a pandemic, why should you deny yourself a freshly made cookie or second vodka tonic? It isn\u2019t like you have anywhere to go. Even Zoom cocktail parties can be attended in pajamas.\nAnd yet, regretfully, for myself, I\u2019m going to have to say no.\nI don\u2019t want to be a scold. But like the scale and the blood sugar monitor, diabetes ticks on, not caring that a pandemic has turned our normal routines upside down. No matter what, its end-goal is clear: to wreck your small blood vessels, causing issues for your heart, your kidney, your eyes. And beyond.\nSo, while I know it\u2019s going to be difficult, I\u2019m going back on the wagon. Counting calories, getting in an extra walk, taking more blood sugar readings than usual. Returning to my yoga practice. Nibbling on celery and carrot sticks while I cook.\nBecause while we can always conceal an extra few pounds behind a bulky sweatshirt, complications can\u2019t be so easily ignored.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},
{"headline": "How Mindful Walking Is Improving My Diabetes Care", "body": "If you\u2019re not a bit anxious these days, you probably aren\u2019t paying attention.\nTuning out cable news and social media might be an option, but as a news junkie, I find that route impossible.\u00a0\nEnter mindful walking.\nTo be clear: I am not the mindful type. When it comes to walking (or any other exercise), I\u2019ve always been about the burn. To keep my type 2 diabetes in check, working out means working at the highest level of exertion to torch maximum calories and lower blood sugars.\nYet over the last months spent sheltering in place, I\u2019ve had a shift in attitude. While I still hit my stationary bike for a fast hour four times a week and complete a full body weight workout three times a week, I\u2019ve noticed that other, more contemplative activities have gained more appeal. For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve started a regular yoga class (online, of course) and added meditative walking to my day.\nNeither activity eats up calories or sends my glucose down as fast as my more strenuous workouts. But the two have helped me combat anxiety and stress, both of which can also raise blood sugars.\nMy first encounter with mindful walking was a fiasco. Several years back, during a meditation retreat in Italy, our Zen master, a woman of very few words, led a group of us back and forth between a small stand of trees. Watching me jump into the lead, she approached and whispered, \u201cYou have an airport walk.\u201d\nAt first her words made no sense. But as she slipped behind and I continued to barrel forward, her words caught me: I was racing through the secluded countryside as if I were hurrying to catch a plane.\nAt the time, though, I shook her off. The entire concept of going slow annoyed me. Life was short! \u00a0Why not hurry to get where you wanted to go?\nBut sequestered at home, I\u2019ve had a change of heart. In the absence of people to meet and places to go, I\u2019ve developed an odd and inexplicable appreciation for taking my time: \u00a0eating more slowly, savoring a glass of wine, even taking my time folding clothes.\u00a0\nAnd, I\u2019ve been practicing walking mindfully. Rather than fixing on how far or fast I can go, I\u2019ve focused on sensations that I might otherwise ignore. Like how my breath enters and leaves my body, the feel of the ground beneath the balls of my feet, how my head balances on my neck. And when my mind inevitably wanders or I feel myself speeding up, I gently guide myself back to the sensations of propelling myself through space and nothing else.\nAll of this is harder than it sounds, but with practice, you might find yourself looking forward to these moments of escape from the tensions of your day. The steps may not be aerobic, but sometimes slow going gets you places you might not expect.\n\u00a0\n"},
{"headline": "10 Superfoods for Diabetes", "body": "If you\u2019ve read any health or nutrition headlines the past few years, you\u2019ve likely seen the term \u201csuperfoods\u201d used to describe foods that have been shown to provide significant health benefits. While there is no true definition of a \u201csuperfood,\u201d the consensus within the food industry is that these foods are powerhouses for things like vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, enzymes, and antioxidants. If eaten often (and in combination), they can also play a critical role in stabilizing blood glucose, help to ward off other conditions like certain cancers and heart disease, and simply promote overall healthy eating habits.\nHere are ten \u201csuperfoods\u201d to consider adding into the rotation for your weekly meal plans:\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nDark, \n like spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are chock-full of nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium. Some studies have even shown leafy greens to play a role in reducing the risk of \n.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nCitrus fruits like \n are naturally low-glycemic and are rich in vitamin C to help boost the immune system. They also contain nutrients like folate and potassium, which have been shown to support healthy blood pressure.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \n\r\n          \n and \n are packed full of healthy fats and fiber that help to protect the heart and can help in stabilizing blood sugars. They are also a good source of plant protein. Try adding a handful to your morning oatmeal or pair with a piece of a fruit for a balanced snack.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \n\r\n          \n are foods that include things like black, pinto, and garbanzo \n, as well as peas and lentils. They contain an abundance of fiber and plant-based protein that can aid in healthy digestion and stable blood glucose levels.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nAnother great source of fiber, \n has been shown to boost heart health and help people living with type 2 diabetes hit \n when eaten regularly. For the healthiest option, choose steel-cut or \u201cold fashioned\u201d oats that don\u2019t contain added sugars. Sweeten yourself with a teaspoon of honey or fresh berries and add a splash of milk, nuts, or seeds for some added protein.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nEating healthy fat is paramount in promoting heart health, especially for those living with diabetes, as they are at higher risk for developing heart health conditions. The monounsaturated fats found in \n can help to lower cholesterol, reduce overall inflammation in the body, and promote a healthy blood pressure. They also contain a decent amount of fiber that can keep blood sugars steady.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \n\r\n          \n, along with other cruciferous veggies, is loaded with antioxidants. They are also an excellent source of fiber and contain certain phytochemicals that may help in preventing certain kinds of cancer.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nA key nutrient found in \n is lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant that boosts heart health and lowers risk for certain types of cancer. Tomatoes are also high in Vitamin C, which has been known to lower elevated blood sugar levels and minimize blood sugar spikes after meals in those with type 2 diabetes.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \n\r\n          \n are a starchy, root vegetable that are best known for their sweet taste and high levels of fiber, especially when compared to regular potatoes. They also provide a plant-based source of protein, which can help to keep you feel full longer between meals while keeping blood sugars stable.\n\r\n          \n\r\n        \nA summertime favorite, \n are low-glycemic and especially helpful in fighting inflammation. Look for tart cherries, which contain high levels of antioxidants. The best options are usually fresh or frozen since they don\u2019t contain added sugar like many of the canned or dried varieties.\n"},
{"headline": "Why I\u2019m Changing My Tune on Telehealth", "body": "At the pandemic\u2019s start, my endocrinologist\u2019s office phoned to let me know that they were no longer seeing patients in the office and asked if I would like to reschedule my upcoming appointment for an online visit.\nI said no.\nMy decision had nothing to do with wanting to avoid my appointment.\u00a0 Quite the opposite.\nI know that many people with diabetes dread endo visits, but I actually like them. They tend to be free-wheeling discussions of my diabetes care \u2013 my doctor and I review my most recent lab work, check weight and cholesterol, and consider if I am experiencing any burn out when it comes to having a chronic condition.\nOften, issues that I didn\u2019t expect to discuss arise during our time together: Were the occasional pins and needles I was feeling in my feet early signs of neuropathy? Why was I having more lows than usual? \u00a0And because my endocrinologist listens to my questions and takes my issues seriously, they often respond with useful suggestions that help me to improve my care.\nThis is the kind of interaction I was convinced I\u2019d miss out on if I met with my doctor online. I worried that a telemedicine visit might be less personal and less thorough. That limiting our communication through a screen might hamper what had been, up until now, excellent care. And how can you evaluate someone\u2019s overall health without having a body in the room?\nBut since then, \u00a0I\u2019ve had a few chances to reconsider my position on telehealth.\nWhen I recently developed a sore throat, for example, the nurse practitioner from my internist\u2019s practice joined me on Zoom. After questioning me about my symptoms for a good ten to fifteen minutes, they ordered antibiotics which cured the infection in a few days.\nI\u2019ve also been meeting with my psychologist online. When we first made the switch to virtual appointments, anticipating that we would not be able to speak as openly or freely online, I suggested we meet less frequently. But after I shared my misgivings about telehealth, my therapist offered their own hesitations. And somehow, following an honest discussion about each of our issues around the medium, it became easier to talk about other topics as well. While we agree the medium isn\u2019t ideal for therapy, we\u2019ve settled into a reasonable mode of operation.\u00a0\nAs for my endo, I have an in-person appointment scheduled for \u00a0September. Given the current spread of the virus, a face to face meeting is not guaranteed. Despite my hesitation, we may next meet on screen. It will take some adjustments, I\u2019m sure. But I may as well embrace it. Now that the use of telemedicine is so widespread , it may be here to stay, pandemic or no. So, if we are cancelled in person, in the interest of my best health, I\u2019m planning on casting aside my doubts and jumping in.\n(Note that the only way I could justify delaying my routine appointment was because my recent A1C\u2019s have run steadily between 5.7 and 6.1, and my daily numbers and weight have been pretty good as well.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},
